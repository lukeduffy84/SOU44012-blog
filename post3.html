          <p>Similar to last term with the Northern Ireland module, much of this week has been spent trying to apply different sociological models and constructs to the Israel/Palestine conflict, in particular the ‘settler colonialism’ paradigm. It seems the more this course progresses, the more similarities I find between the colonialist nature of Israel and the similarities the region has with Northern Ireland. This week in particular really changed my opinion on what I see as the major 
‘Blame’ factor if you will for the world’s colonial problems, which in my opinion is the justification for the initial incursion to colonize a region. While examples of Northern Ireland and Australia made no attempt at moral justification of removing locals through war or structural violence other than love of King and country, In my head I had partitioned Israel/Palesitne away from this categorisation due to the Zionist arguments of consistent persecution of Jews throughout history. However this week's readings and tutorials really challenged my thinking on that, in particular Piterberg’s book (2008) where he almost ticks off each box as to why Zionism is actually indistinguishable from my earlier examples of 19th century colonialism.
In particular, I found Piterberg’s take on the illegitimacy of the Bible as an historic record to be quite interesting, especially when you consider that this forms much of the crux of the Zionist argument of ‘returning’ to their lands with the Bible acting in their eyes as a sort of property deed for modern day Israel.

          <span class="caption text-muted">The Bible is one of the key reasons Jewish people believe Israel is rightfully theirs.</span>

          <p>As an agnostic myself, this idea that the Bible was a justifiable pillar of any colonial incursion really made it more difficult for me to see Zionism in the middle-east any more justifiable than the many abhorrent examples of European colonialism that came before it. 
Sternhall’s counter arguments including the Arab invasion of Palestine in 1948 and the resulting Arab siege since this date seems a very similar argument to the other colonialist examples of IRA violence, where again I would argue such acts (while abhorrent) are still reactionary in nature.
