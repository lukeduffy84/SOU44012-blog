         Discussion in week 3 centered around the failings of the Israeli/Palestine court system and the different theoretical models one could try to apply to the region. In particular I found David’s argument that Israel is in fact a democracy despite the clear mistreatement of Palisteninans as second class citizens, as I wrongly assumed that the latter fact of discrimination negated the democratic legitmacy of the Israeli state. David also made a fantastic example this week when he gave the example of the Arab City of Jaffa and the corrupt mayor Shimon Gapso who promised an Arab school to voters and then reneged on his promise to do so.

          <p>My reflexive reaction of this was to immediately see it through the prism of Arab discrimination, and it was only when David challenged us on how politicians lying is any different from other democracies that I began to change my perspective on it. While I still believe there certainly is a racial element to the mayor's actions, David's point and the discussion that followed certainly made me question the black and white nature of my previous thinking, especially when I began to reflect on how Irish politicians similarly lie all the time about direct provision policy and was struggling to differentiate this from Jaffa example. 
This similar challenging of definitions was also extended into the theoretical models, where I found Zreik’s (2004) argument against defining it as an Apartheid state quite compelling. While the racial discrimination and empitihetic sentiment between Aparthied South Africa and Palestine is clear, Zreiks point that Palestinans are struggling for deconlisation of the region into two states as opposed to equality in the same state really changed my mind on the subject. I also found that another of Zreiks points about the fragmentation of Palestinian identity and groups also tied in with the +972 podcast from last week, which really opened my eyes to the lack of political unity between Palestenians in the West Bank and Palestinans within Israel. 
The podcast similarly talks about how the term ‘Palestenian’ is really an amalgamation of many different groups when it talks about contemporary politics in the country, not dissimilar from any other political system.
